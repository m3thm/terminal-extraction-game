# SpyNet-A-Turn-Based-Game-written-in-C
This is my submission for an individual assignment for my first semester at university. It entails making a simple game in C that runs in the terminal. The map consists of a NxN grid (5&lt;= N &lt;= 15) and it is a turn based game where players take turns moving from square to square trying to collect "intel" and reaching an "extraction point" to win.
