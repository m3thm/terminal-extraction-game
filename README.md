This is my submission for an individual assignment for my first semester at university. It entails making a simple game in C that runs in the terminal. The map consists of a NxN grid (5&lt;= N &lt;= 15) and it is a turn based game where players take turns moving from square to square trying to collect "intel" and reaching an "extraction point" to win.
You can use the following command to compile the game onto the build folder,
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Iinclude src/*.c -o build/game
